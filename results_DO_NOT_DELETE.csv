HELLThis is by far the most playful bike Ive ever owned Over the past 3 years I have been updating all of the components without end and havent stopped until I was felt I had the most fun best bike I could possibly get my hands on Im definitely a gear nut Absolutely SICK I seriously cant put into words how fun and exhilarating this bike it Have I mentioned that its just so much damn fun The tail whips around corners with ease she feels like a fifth limb in midair and Ill make a 200 guarantee right now that you wont be able to hold back a hoop or holler your first time riding this thingIm serious this 200 money back guarrantee comes with this beastBETTER YET Pay me 200 less off the bat and only pay me the last 200 once youre 100 convinced of all Ive written here Hold me to itIm currently in Idaho Happy to ship bike here if youre pretty sure you want it but want to give it a look to make sure everythings 110 kosherIf youre just looking for your next race bike keep on looking She does well on uphills largely due to the Push Eleven6 shock amazing but by no means rockets up them But give her the slightest goahead the faintest sign to let it rip and she PURRSShe gets feisty if you dont humor her with the regular wheelie slide or huck she likes a balanced diet of all three But screw my enthusiasm heres a review that sums it up real well httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv28KJoKIWn0Trying to find a good home for this beauty read beast I messed up my leg pretty bad in a ski crash last February and it doesnt look like Ill be able to keep her satisfied in the near future It makes me sad as hell but she deserves better than collecting dust in my basement havent ridden her more than say 10 very easygoing hours in the past yearGreat condition but ridden for two consistent years so she does have a couple cosmetic blemishes here and there on the frame from typical use of a bike chain slap shuttles and riding but nothing that will affect performance I tried detailing them here as best I couldThe suspension is completely done and worked over by Push Comes with a Push ElevenSix shock which is awesome for climbing and with a flick of the switch it absolutely shreds downhill  it may easily be the best shock out there and it feels like its purposemade for this bike  silky smooth forgiving and yet tempting and above all playful as all hell It is tuned for 135 lb to 195 lb rider weight but can easily be reworked by Push to your liking weight and ride styleThe Fork is tuned by Push as well to work perfectly along with the shock and frame its silky smooth Feels great plush af yet confidenceinspiring and once again super playful I dont know what Push does but it is buttery smooth in the chunk and braking bumps feel

service please call ahead to book appointmentwwwrbincsportscomRIDE POSITIONA usual complaint from new riders trying to get into the cycling groove is feeling uncomfortably perched forward with too much weight on their wrists and having to crank their necks backwards just to be able to see in traffic We specifically design our Explorers to remedy this With extra long head tubes to push handlebar height up shorter top tubes to pull handlebars closer to the saddle 4inch rise handlebars that sweep back at a natural handgrasp angle and longquilled or angleadjustable stems that allow for a wide range of adjustment to tune handle bar height and reach perfectly for each riderSUSPENSIONEvery Explorer offers telesoping coilspring suspension in the fork as well as in the seat pillar The advantage is not just a more comfortable ride but a ride that is much easier to control and is therefore saferCOMFORT SADDLEOur super plush saddle features memory foam padding Explorer 2 or extra high quality polyurethane padding Explorer 1 for optimum support with maximum comfort The slipresistant suedetype top prevents sliding and the burnished side panels reduce leg friction while pedaling Elastomer springs also help to soak up road vibrations Offered in gender specific sizesSMOOTH ROLLING TIRESOur Explorer tires have been designed to roll smoothly on pavement but offer a large 195” footprint so that rides on park paths can be managed securely The additional benefit of that big footprint is larger air volume in the tire and tube which results in lower air pressure for a more comfortable ride than tires with smaller volumes and higher air pressuresVERSATILITYBut don’t let all this comfort talk fool you into thinking the Explorer has limited uses While conceived to make cycling as comfortably fun as possible the Explorer is capable of doing much more than keeping a new rider from hurting Thanks to the fullrange gearing of the drivetrain the 2” footprint of the tires and the shock absorption of the suspension forkTWISTSHIFTING GEARSMany folks find throttlestyle shifters much simpler to use than those that operate by thumb There’s something intuitive about simply twsiting the inboard side of your handlebar grips to change the speed at which your pedaling Which why our Explorers feature Grip Shift from SRAM or Revoshift from Shimano twist shiftersFrame 6061 TIGwelded
